# Low brightness mode for Glass

Very simple APK I threw together. Usage:

```
Okay Glass, low brightness mode [pause]: on
```

or

```
Okay Glass, low brightness mode [pause]: off
```

Low brightness mode will turn off auto brightness and set the backlight to 0. Why would you do that? It's an experiment I'm trying to see if it will save battery when recording or streaming.

You won't be able to see the viewfinder well (or at all), but you can check the screen on your Android with the screencast if you need to start an app.

Results are inconclusive right now, but it seems reasonable to save battery.
